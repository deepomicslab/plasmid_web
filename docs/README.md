# Welcome to PlasmidScope

[PlasmidScope](https://plasmid.deepomics.org/) is an online plasmid database, including 1,045,930 plasmid sequences with comprehensive annotations. PlasmidScope incorporates automatic analysis and interactive visualization.

## Database

We have collected the plasmids across multiple public repositories and datasets to facilitate a complete plasmid database. As a result, we have integrated a dataset comprising 1,045,930 plasmid sequences collected from nine databases, including RefSeq, Genbank, EMBL, DDBJ, TPA, PLSDB, COMPASS, Kraken2, mMGEs and IMG-PR.

To provide comprehensive and accurate annotations for the integrated plasmid database, we applied fifteen state-of-the-art tools to perform mobility assessment, completeness assessment, host annotation, plasmid clustering, structural annotation (ORFs, tRNA, tmRNA, and CRISPR/Cas system), functional annotation (virulence factors, antibiotic resistance genes, signal peptides, transmembrane proteins), protein structure prediction, and sequence comparison (sequence alignment, and comparative tree) for the plasmids. All of the 1,045,930 plasmids and their annotated information are available in PlasmidScope.

## Analysis
PlasmidScope provides online analyzing modules for users to analyze their customized data. Users can upload single or multiple plasmid sequences in fasta format and perform annotation with the selected module(s). The analyzing modules can be divided into two sections: First, plasmid annotation, including ORF prediction & protein classification, tRNA & tmRNA annotation, Virulent factor & antimicrobial resistance gene detection, and Transmembrane protein annotation; Second, plasmid comparison, including Sequence alignment and Phylogenetic analysis. PlasmidScope performs automatic analysis and returns results that can be visualized and downloaded.

## Visualization

PlasmidScope supports interactive visualization of the curated database and customized analysis results. Specifically, PlasmidScope generates completeness and phenotype distribution charts, graphical annotation, multiple sequence alignment visualizations, and comparative tree visualizations. All visualizations can be downloaded in high-quality publication-ready format.
