# How to perform PlasmidScope visualizations

PlasmidScope offers interactive visualizations for curated database and customized analysis results. The visualizations, which support informative tooltips to deliver detailed introductions and information, are prepared in an optional format with high quality, making them seamlessly incorporated into academic publications.  

We provide some demo visualizations in this tutorial.  

+ **The PlasmidScope visualization of the ORFs and proteins on plasmid genomes.** PlasmidScope provides the linear (**a**) and circular (**b**) annotation visualizations. Diverse color codes signify the functional affiliation of each encoded protein; the arrow orientations demonstrate the transcriptional directionality; the blue polylines indicate the GC content within a sliding window of 30 bp; the red/green polylines indicate the GC skew within a sliding window of 30 bp.

+ **The PlasmidScope visualization of the protein functional class distributions.** The upper heatmap showcases the percentage of ten functional classes for each plasmid, whereas the lower heatmap demonstrates the count of each functional class.

+ **The PlasmidScope visualization of the functional elements.** Based on the structural annotation visualization, the outermost circle shows the locations of the predicted tRNA and tmRNA (**a**), CRISPR/Cas systems (**b**), signal peptides (**c**), virulent factor (**d**), antimicrobial resistance gene (**e**), as well as protein transmembrane topology (**f**).

+ **The PlasmidScope visualization of the sequence alignment.** PlasmidScope provides the linear (**a**) and circular (**b**) alignment visualizations. The color depth of the gray strips indicates the alignment coverage, whereas the color depth of the vertical blocks indicates the alignment identity.
